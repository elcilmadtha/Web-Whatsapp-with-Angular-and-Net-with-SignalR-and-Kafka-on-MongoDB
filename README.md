A full-stack real-time chat application inspired by WhatsApp, built with the latest Angular and .NET Core frameworks. This project demonstrates how to design and deploy a scalable, event-driven messaging platform with real-time communication, containerized deployment, and infrastructure automation.

✅ Project Overview
This application replicates the core features of a chat platform like WhatsApp for the web. It leverages SignalR for real-time messaging, Kafka for message streaming and event-driven communication, and MongoDB for chat persistence. The project is fully containerized using Docker, orchestrated with Kubernetes, and deployed via CI/CD pipelines. Infrastructure and Kafka topic provisioning are automated using Terraform.

✅ Key Features

Real-Time Messaging
Powered by SignalR for instant communication between users.

Event-Driven Architecture
Apache Kafka handles asynchronous messaging and event streaming.

Scalable Deployment
Containerized with Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes (K8s).

CI/CD Pipeline
Automated build and deployment pipelines for smooth delivery.

Kafka UI Monitoring
View messages in Kafka through an integrated Kafka UI.

Infrastructure as Code
Manage Kafka topics and versioning via Terraform.
